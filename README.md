Salary Estimation Project

This project aims to predict the salaries of employees based on years of experience, education level, and age using multiple regression techniques. The goal is to explore different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance in estimating salary.

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Statsmodels

Decision Trees and Random Forest Regressor

Project Overview
This repository contains code to estimate salaries for employees based on:

Years of experience

Education level (in this case, 1 for undergraduate, 2 for graduate, etc.)

Age



Different regression models were used for estimation:

1. Linear Regression

2. Polynomial Regression

3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

4. Decision Tree Regression

5. Random Forest Regression
